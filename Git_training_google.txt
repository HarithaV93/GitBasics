What is ditributed versioning system?

In a centralized vesrioning system, we check out only files we need. We might not have all the files from the server

In a distributed versioning system, we have all the files in the server locally. after checkout you dont need connection 
to serve to modify the files. Git stores all the history and it is easy to connect it back to server again

Origin of Git
- invented for vesrion control for linux kernal development in 2005

Git hub

How to create a repository (or database for files)
1. git init
2. git clone

.git folder contains all the history of the database (most of them are human readable)

files and folders next to .git are called working tree
if no files or folders, then its called bare repository- used in servers
